--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.77
August-31-2010
Updated by Zybby
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Used a different compiler to create the Windows version.
   Hopefully this will resolve a particular 'badf' load error some people have
   been experiencing.

-  The bot behaviour code has been re-written to allow for more advanced behaviour.
   The bots can now multitask by keeping track of a number of jobs that they
   currently want to do and prioritising which job they think is the most important.

-  Medic and Engineer bots can now navigate via waypoints to a more distant ally
   that they want to heal/repair.

-  The bots can now wait for a Medic to reach them if they call for one.

-  Fixed a problem where the bots didn't know they were still infected if the medic
   who infected them then changed to a new class.

-  Snipers can now stop and begin charging their rifles just before moving into
   a sniper waypoint.

-  Demomen bots can now use the Pipebomb Launcher as a normal combat weapon.

-  Demomen wont detpack a waypoint if they arrive and find a detpack there already
	or can see that it has been detpacked already.

-  Bot Engineers can now volunteer to play offense or defense on their teams.

-  Bots on defense can now patrol from defense waypoint to defense waypoint.

-  The bots can now guard a flag that an opposing team has dropped.
	They can also report it's location if they know the area.

-  Bots of skill 1, 2 and 3 will now try to find somewhere to surface and breathe if
   they start drowning.

-  The hunted can go look for the last seen ally if he is alone.
   He can also open the exit garage doors to let himself out.

-  Intimidated bots can hide out of sight of an enemy and then wait a short while
   for allies to come along.

-  The bots can tell when a grenade has ceased to be a threat if they were avoiding it.

-  The bots can now escort or pursue players they can't see by making predictions
   about where to find them.

-  The bots have a better understanding of how high they can concussion or rocket jump.
   They also check for low ceilings, and can detect rocket/concussion jump waypoints better.

-  If not facing a jump waypoint fully then the bots will pause until they're
   ready to jump.

-  When climbing ladders the bots check their height more precisely compared
   with their next waypoint.  i.e. they climb ladders more accurately.
   They also try to prevent ladder traffic jams by jumping off before they occur.

-  Bot navigation has been improved when they are fighting underwater.

-  The Bots are better at recognising when they have fallen off of a ledge.

-  Fixed a few problems when the bots try to use lifts.

-  The bots can react to footstep sounds if footsteps are active on the server.

-  Each bot has a memory for a maximum of three different Teleporter pairs at any one time.
   First they can test any Teleporters they find to see where they go,
   afterwards they can use them as shortcuts to destinations.

-  The bots can now attack any enemy owned Teleporters they find.

-  The bots can now attack any breakable items they come across.

-  The bots will throw grenades more directly at the last known enemy position,
   and will not twitch any more if throwing an uneeded grenade away.

-  The bots crouch when they are just above their target so that their
   close combat weapons can reach.

-  Engineers will detonate their Teleporters if the waypoints they built them
   at are no longer available(because of a map script).

-  Updated the counter-classing code.  Bots can choose certain classes if
   those classes aren't on their team and they are getting killed by a player
   who has a significantly better score than they do.
   They may try to counter-class high scoring Snipers with Snipers or HW Guys,
   Engineers with Spies, and Medics with Medics(to counter infection).

-  Fixed a bug where two or more bots could end up with the same name even though
   there were more than enough unique names available.

-  New config setting: bot_allow_moods (0 - 1)
   When set active each bot can have a randomly assigned set of personality
   characteristics.  Turn this off if you want all the bots to have the same
   average personality profile.

-  New config setting: bot_allow_humour (0 - 1)
   When this is active the bots are allowed to go a bit crazy occasionally and
   do fun stuff that probably wont help them win the game.

-  New bot personality trait/mood.
   Humour.  i.e. how willing the bot is to do something daft to lighten the moment.

-  New bot personality trait/mood.
   Aggression.
   More aggressive bots are less likely to back out of a fight, and more
   likely to pursue enemies if they think they have the upper hand.
   Low aggression bots are more cautious of enemies.

-  New personality trait/mood: fairplay.
   The higher this trait is the more likely the bot is to play honorably.
   For example:
      1. A more honorable bot is more likely to join a team that has the fewest
         players.
      2. A more honorable bot is more likely to switch teams if bot_team_balance
         is switched off and the teams become unbalanced.

-  New behaviour that may trigger if bot_allow_humour is active.
   Individual bots may decide to go on the rampage with just close combat
   weapons if they haven't seen any enemies for a while.

-  New behaviour that may trigger if bot_allow_humour is active.
   The bots can choose to go and spray a nearby wall if they haven't seen
   any enemies for a while.

-  New console command: spectate_debug (0 - 4)
   This command has been created primarily for Foxbot development purposes.
   When this is active a hosting human spectator(on a listen server) who comes really
   close to a bot will trigger detailed debug messages about it's behaviour.

-  Updated the bot chat system and the bot chat file.
   Chat section headers are now enclosed by these symbols - '['  and ']'
   The chat sections can also appear in any order.
   Older Foxbot chat files are not compatible with this release(easy to convert though).

-  A new pair of bot settings have been added.
   bot_skill_1_aim and bot_aim_per_skill.
   When used together you can set the accuracy levels for all bot skill levels.
   Please see the foxbot.cfg or bot documentation for information on how they operate.

-  Bot accuracy is now less twitchy and more human-like in style.

-  Fixed the pause config setting(the delay before bots join the server).
   Now it works as documented.

-  New config setting: bot_create_interval.
   This setting governs the delay between spawning one bot and the next
   when the server is being automatically filled with bots.

-  New bot setting added: bot_total_varies.
   This setting can be used to help simulate playing TFC online.
   When it is active the number of bots on the server will fluctuate from
   min_bots to max_bots randomly.

-  Different bots now prefer different classes which means:
      1. If team balance is switched off then the bots may pick teams based
         upon what classes each team offers.
      2. A bot that is allowed to change class may play longer with a class
         it prefers.

-  bot_can_build_teleporter and bot_can_use_teleporter now work as server commands
   for all server types.

-  Fixed a waypoint editing bug where the script number flags for a waypoint weren't
   being cleared when the waypoint was deleted. (this bug appeared in Foxbot 0.76)

-  The 'locate_waypoint' command now provides information about the height and distance
   of the waypoint relative to the host player on a listen server.
   Also it will give the route distance from the nearest waypoint if possible.

-  More waypoint file fixes and tweaks for the standard maps.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.76
March-1-2010
Updated by Zybby
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  The Foxbot directory is now placed in the \tfc\addons\ directory by default.
   This has been done to simplify installation, and because Foxbot is
   primarily a TFC bot.

-  The log file 'bot.txt' has been renamed to 'foxbot.log' and moved to the
   \foxbot\ directory.

-  Each time Foxbot is started, and if it needs to log something the 'foxbot.log'
   file from a previous session will be renamed to 'foxbot.log.old'.
   Then a new log will be started.

-  A warning is logged in the console if the Foxbot log file could not be created.
   With older Foxbot releases, failure to create a log file could crash the server.
   This has been fixed in this release.

-  The bots can now roam maps by choosing alternate routes to any goal waypoint
   on any map whenever they want to.

-  The bots will try to find another route to their objective if their path is
   unexpectedly blocked(e.g. by rubble or a temporary wall).

-  New waypoint tag added: 'Detpack Seal'.  Demoman bots will only set detpacks
   near them if all the connected paths are clear of obstructions.
   i.e. This waypoint tag tells Demomen to try and close a passageway.

-  The normal detpack waypoint tag has been converted into a 'detpack clear'
   waypoint tag.
   Demoman bots will only set detpacks near them if either:
      1. Any of the connected paths are obstructed(e.g. by a destroyable wall).
      2. The detpack waypoint is only connected to one other waypoint.
   The detpack points in most existing waypoint files and scripts
   should still work okay despite this change.

-  New waypoint tag added: 'Path Check'.  When a bot encounters a Path Check
   waypoint it will test if the path from that waypoint is obstructed or not
   before proceeding.  This waypoint type is useful for dealing with un-scriptable
   obstacles, such as the time delayed walls on Dustbowl.

-  Foxbot 0.76 can now support more waypoint tags than Foxbot 0.75.
   Please note:
   1. Waypoint files created by Foxbot 0.76(and newer) are not compatible with
      Foxbot 0.75(and older).
   2. Foxbot 0.76 can still load the older waypoint files that Foxbot 0.75
      can load.
   3. Waypoint files created with Foxbot 0.76 and above will be a little bit
      larger than before.

-  Bots now keep track of where they spawn so that they have some idea of
   where their teams home base is.

-  Infected bots target the furthest enemy defender waypoints from their spawn
   location.  This should stop them bringing the infection home on all maps.

-  Bots now have a larger sight radius when keeping an eye out for dropped flags
   and are able to navigate to them more successfully.

-  Bots will report the position of a spotted enemy flag carrier if
   defensive_chatter is active and they think that they are not powerful enough
   to stop the carrier.  This can cause other bots on defense to come and help.

-  Bots that have been fragged may change class to Demoman if a map has active
   detpack waypoints, and their team has no Demomen.

-  If a map has active detpack waypoints then Demomen will no longer volunteer
   for a defensive role even though a defender is needed. (was broken in 0.705)

-  Demomen will try to vacate the area after they have placed a detpack.

-  Only bots that were around to see a sentry gun get destroyed will report
   its destruction.

-  Fixed a bug where bot Snipers would (very rarely) snipe a Medic teammate
   on purpose.

-  Higher skilled bots now jump more often when fighting a nearby Soldier or Pyro.

-  Higher skilled bots will try to jump over any caltrops in their path.

-  The "waypoint delete" command can now delete aim indicator waypoints
   that are not near enough to a normal waypoint.
   A red line will appear if the aim indicator waypoint is near enough
   to another waypoint.

-  Added Exit options to all waypoint editor menu lists.

-  A bot that has just been created will no longer inherit private data from
   a player who has left the server(e.g. their score and deaths).

-  Fixed some bot initialisation issues to improve long-term stability when
   the number of bots on a server keeps changing.

-  Waypoint updates for all non-custom maps.

-  Added an area file for ravelin.

-  Updated the area file for dustbowl(most of the map is now defined).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.75
December-30-2009
Updated by Zybby
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  A Bot that is having trouble aiming at a target may fire less often for a
   few moments in order to avoid wasting ammo on bad shots.

-  Each bots aim is now negatively affected by it's own speed and by the
   speed of it's target.

-  Bots can now notice when a concussion jump failed to boost them near enough
   to the concussion jump waypoint they were aiming for, and will rethink their
   goal when this happens.

-  Bots will only chat if they can see no enemies nearby.
   They will also pause briefly when chatting, as if typing on a keyboard.

-  The bot setting bot_chat can now be set to a number from 0 to 1000.
   The higher this number the more often the bots will chat during the
   course of a game.  Or you can set it to 0 to stop them chatting completely.

-  New config setting and console command: bot_use_grenades (0 - 2).
   When set to 0 the bots are not allowed to use any grenades.
   When set to 1 the bots may concussion jump.
   When set to 2 the bots can use all grenades freely.
   [Change made from a request by [EI]Weasel]

-  The bot setting botskill has been replaced with two new bot settings:
   botskill_lower and botskill_upper.
   These allow you to set the range of randomly selected skill levels
   that bots will spawn with, when they join a game automatically.

-  Defenders no longer forget the waypoint they were defending when they
   go to investigate a suspicious sound.

-  All bots now listen out for sounds that their enemies may make(e.g. a grenade
   being primed, or a crowbar being swung about).  This makes them more aware
   of any potential attackers in the area.

-  Medics and Engineers may now investigate calls for a Medic that they hear
   coming from an unknown source.
   This also means that they can now respond to calls for a Medic coming
   from bot teammates, not just human players.

-  Bots now check to see if a Medic is present on their team before calling for
   a Medic.  Much the same way as humans can check the score board for Medics.

-  Bots will not call for a Medic if they are already heading towards a health
   waypoint.

-  If a map script file issues the script command blue_attack, red_attack,
   green_attack or yellow_attack then that teams bots will be less willing
   to evade enemies, so that they are more aggressive.
   This affects blue teams bot behaviour on Dustbowl for example.

-  Bots now keep track of the number of enemies and allies they can see nearby.
   The more a bot is outnumbered the more likely it will be to prime a grenade
   and/or evade it's enemies.
   The reverse is true if it's enemy appears to be outnumbered.

-  If a bot on offense spots another bot on offense then it might decide to
   tag along with that bot for a while so that they can combine their
   firepower and abilities.

-  Bots(especially bot defenders), when suspicious of a disguised enemy Spy,
   may follow the Spy about for a bit before they decide to attack him.

-  Bots with skill levels 3, 4 and 5 no longer pause during a concussion jump.

-  Bots with skill levels 3, 4 and 5 no longer pause for a "think" whilst
   underwater.

-  Bots of all skill levels may now pause occasionally as if having a think.
   Bots of skill levels 3 - 5 no longer pause as often as they used to.
   Also, when bots pause to "think" they will look around them, in case they
   spot anything interesting.

-  Changes have been made to reduce occurences of "suicide by grenade".
   These changes are:
   1. If a bot is holding a live grenade and has no enemy it will try to
      throw the grenade at the last known enemy position, or at some distant
      visible point.
   2. Bots take their health into account when deciding when to throw a held
      grenade.  The less health they have the sooner they throw.
   3. Bots are less likely to prime a grenade when standing right next to
      their enemies.
   4. Bots are encouraged to retreat from an enemy if the enemy is very near
      and the bot is about to throw a grenade at them.

-  Medics and Scouts may throw concussion grenades at enemies if they feel
   threatened enough.  If they have only one concussion grenade left they
   will keep it for concussion jumping with.

-  Medics and Snipers may throw frag grenades at their enemies, not just at sentry guns.

-  Outnumbered spies may throw gas grenades at enemies as well as frag grenades.

-  Outnumbered Heavy weapon guys and Demomen are more likely to throw MIRV
   grenades at enemies than frag grenades.

-  Outnumbered Soldiers are more likely to throw nail grenades at enemies than
   frag grenades.

-  Minor waypoint tweaks for: badlands, casbah, epicenter, flagrun, hunted and well.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.74
October-19-2009
Updated by Zybby
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Bots on offense, other than Scouts and Civilians, will now occasionally
   seek out enemy defense waypoints to attack.  Targetted waypoint types
   include: defender, pipetrap, sentry gun and sniper.

-  Classes other than Scout and Civilian will try to go for flag waypoints
   that are not already occupied by a bot teammate.  If none were found they
   will assist the offense in other ways.

-  Bots now attempt to push buttons much more accurately.

-  No more than 2 bots will try to use the same lift at the same time,
   so that they don't overcrowd it and block it's movement.

-  Bots will sometimes back away from nearby enemy Medics who they are
   fighting, unless they are Medics themselves.

-  Fixed a bug in Foxbot 0.73 which allowed infected bots to
   occasionally seek health.

-  Infected bots will prefer to seek out the furthest enemy defender,
   sentry gun or sniper waypoint from their current position.
   This is done so that they move away from their home base on almost any map.

-  Bots will check when firing rocket launchers or grenade launchers
   to see if there is an object in front and very near, so that they can
   try to avoid "suicide by rocket launcher".

-  The grenade avoidance behaviour has been re-written.  Changes include:
   1. Bots now try to head for waypoints that are some distance away from
      spotted live grenades.
   2. Bots will only avoid a Spy gas grenade if their health is so low that
      passing through the gas might kill them.
   3. Bots with high health levels will not avoid napalm, nail or grenade
      launcher grenades, but will jump more instead.
   [Changes made from a request by Chaotic Llama]

-  New evasion code.  Bots used to prefer to evade enemies by going to a
   waypoint somewhere behind them.  Now they are more open to evading in
   other directions providing they have a number of routes to choose from.

-  Updated the monitoring of bot ammunition levels.
   Bots of all classes should now seek necessary ammo on maps where
   reachable ammo waypoints exist.

-  Fixed a bug which caused fully stocked Engineers to be on a continuous
   look out for ammunition packs in the area.

-  Spy detection switched to a new system.  Changes include:
   1. When a bot has a new encounter with a disguised enemy Spy it will
      remember him and become suspicious for at least a couple of seconds.
   2. Bots can remember a suspected Spy even if he disappears from view
      for a few seconds.
   3. When it's suspicious enough of the Spy it will then attack him.
   4. bot_spy_random_check is no longer checked or included in this release.

-  Fixed a problem where disguised spys weren't targetting their attackers.

-  Disguised Spys will not shoot at Sentry Guns until a few seconds after
   they have thrown their last frag grenade.
   [Change made from a request by Chaotic Llama]

-  New behaviour when Spy class bots are disguising.
   They may feign, walk or wait depending on how long it's been since
   they last spawned.

-  Spy class bots can now feign death in narrow areas and lie in wait
   for enemy players to come near so that they can ambush them.

-  A number of changes to grenade throwing behaviour, which includes:
   1. All classes carrying Frag grenades can throw them at Sentry Guns.
   2. Bots will try to time their grenade throws more accurately if throwing
      at an enemy Sentry Gun which is significantly higher than them.
   3. When heading for enemy Sentry Guns bots will look for waypoints that are
      near enough for grenade throwing but not so near that they will blow
      themselves up too easily.
   4. Scouts will throw caltrops if near to a dangerous enough enemy.

-  Bot defenders no longer give up their guard positions because another
   bot defender has passed nearby.

-  Bots that get stuck no longer try to pass through defender waypoints,
   because they might get stuck on an allied defender.

-  Bots no longer slow down when nearing teammates who are in their way.
   This can help when faster classes are trying to overtake slower classes.

-  A bots aim will worsen for about a second when it first encounters
   a new enemy, or is affected by an explosion.

-  False "Invalid Character" server warnings should no longer occur.
   These warnings would appear when comment lines in 'foxbot_commanders.txt'
   were longer than 80 characters.
   [Fix requested by [EI]Weasel]

-  Fixed a resource leak, whereby map script files were not always
   being closed after use.

-  Bots can have spaces in their names if you put speech marks around
   the bots name.  For example, if you named a bot: "[FoX]Sniper Geek"
   it's name would appear in game as: [FoX]Sniper Geek
   [Change requested by Grubber]

-  Added Teleporter waypoints to: casbah, crossover2, cz2, epicenter.

-  Converted the help file 'FoxBot_Documentation.chm' back into plain HTML,
   so that it is easier to maintain, and easier to read for Linux users.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.73
July-13-2009
Updated by Zybby/rix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  plugins.ini was mistakenly 'corrected' in 0.72 causing Metamod badf
   errors to occur.  This release should address that issue.

-  Reinstated the original Linux makefile and built the Linux version from it.
   This may fix an issue some Linux users were having getting the Foxbot plugin to load.

-  Tweaked the bots to make them smarter about when to evade enemies
   and how far to travel when they do.

-  Civilian class bots weren't evading enemies they can see, this has been fixed.

-  Spys will occasionally feign death when they begin disguising themselves.

-  Bots can occasionally be fooled by a feigning spy, no matter what
   team colour the spy appears to be.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.72
July-6-2009
Updated by Zybby/rix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Fixed a bug where certain bot defender classes(Soldier, HWGuy, Demoman and Pyro)
   would get lost if they were carrying a flag.
   This issue was a common occurrence on cz2 for example.

-  Fixed a bug where bots would fail to exit button activated lifts properly.

-  Certain bot defender classes(Soldier, HWGuy, Demoman and Pyro) can switch
   from defense to offense if there are too many bot defenders on their team.

-  Bots will sometimes pick classes based on which enemy class killed them.
   For example: if a bot was killed by a sentry gun, then it may choose to play
   as a spy or a soldier rather than a scout or a medic.
   As a result they will try to adapt to dominant enemy classes more often.

-  Bots on offense will sometimes try to avoid being shot by certain
   enemy classes by maneuvering around or away from them.
   Snipers and HWGuys are considered especially dangerous(because they are!).

-  Scouts and Demomen will use the crowbar when very near to their enemies.

-  Added a simple Linux makefile to the source code package.

-  Waypoint tweaks for the following maps:
      2Fort, badlands, crossover2, cz2, epicenter, ravelin, rock2, warpath.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.711
June-10-2009
Updated by Zybby/rix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Fixed an issue where heavily injured Sniper bots would obssess about the nearest
   health/armor location until it provided them the health/armor they wanted.

-  Fixed an issue where Snipers would camp with their rifles pointing at
   the sky or the ground.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.710
June-5-2009
Updated by Zybby/rix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  The beginnings of a bot personality trait system.
   New trait: Camper. Snipers with the camper trait prefer to stay in one
   good spot and rack up the kills.
   New trait: Butchness. Some bots tolerate heavier injuries than others
   before seeking health/armor.

-  A bots aim can be disturbed by it being set on fire.

-  Soldiers should no longer linger around concussion/rocket jump
   waypoints that they think are too high for them to reach.

-  Bot Snipers can leave their camping spot for some health/armor and
   if they have the camper trait return to the same spot.

-  Grenade avoidance behaviour has been tweaked to reduce CPU usage and
   smooth out bot movement.

-  Bots base the decision of when to change class upon how their own score changes.

-  Waypointing tweaks for the following maps:
      casbah, crossover2, rock2, warpath.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.705
May-24-2009
Updated by Zybby/rix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  If you don't specify a class with the addbot command then the spawned
   bot will be capable of picking new classes when it dies.
   They will try to pick classes that fit whatever offense/defense role they are playing.

-  Bots try to avoid running into grenades that are visible in front of them.
   Some code was copied over from the HPB bot code to make this happen.

-  Snipers check if a snipe point is already occupied or not before occupying them.

-  Snipers are less likely to vacate a snipe point when they've killed someone.

-  Defenders at defend points look about a bit from time to time.

Version 0.698 Final (Build # was not changed to 0.699 until later. No tweeks/fixes were made)
June-19-2004
This update was created by Grubber and DrEvil
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Added bot engineers making teleporters

-  bots take teams teleporters

I forget whatever else was covered in this build?


About the Teleporters: Un-stable!

The engineer's will build teleporters & the bots will take them & human teleporters.

But if a human builds where a bot has no waypoints, the server WILL crash!!

Unless the server admin places extra waypoints where humans can get but bots can't..

Example: crossover2 base roof's. (i think the water also).

Version 0.698 Final (Change Added by Grubber and DrEvil)
Apr 5 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bots on ladders tweak

foxbot_commanders.txt can load steam ID's

I've compiled this release in Visual C+-  6, can you please test the speed difference
between this build and build 17, there was such a small amount of actual code changed
here you should be able to just do a straight comparison. The DLL came out bigger, which
I didn't expect but if you run a server or something please compare cpu usages.
I'll post a VC+-  .NET compile tomorrow.

Overall Changelog from last full release:

-  Added bot ordering *

-  Implemented "color_attack" and "color_defend" into the start section of scripts.
   These commands adjust the offensive ratio for the team. (see dustbowl script)

-  Rocketjumping -  This feature needs updated waypoints to take advantage of*.

-  Conc Jumping -  This feature needs updated waypoints to take advantage of*.

-  Demo-man bots lay and detonate pipe traps from Demo-man defender waypoints.

-  Script support for defense tags(command points)

-  Engys should pick closest sg point to their own flag if its not already taken.

-  Grenade arc & leading skill based error.

-  Toned down HW-Guy aim.

-  NEO-TF : Pyro bots use the jetpack boost to get to rocketjump points**.

   out of the primary type.

-  Defense classes announce their defend area.

-  Bot Hearing system. Defensive bots should go investigate some common sounds they hear
   while defending.

   These are waypoint tags.

---  1) Normal Defense Point -  Usable by Soldiers/Hwguys/Demo-men

---  2) Demo-man Defense Point -  Usable by demo's only. Favored over normal Defense points so they will lay pipes there.

-  2 new CVARS

---  1) defensive_chatter 1/0 -  controls bots announcing defense related messages.

---  2) offensive_chatter 1/0 -  same for offensive bots.

-  Completely re-arranged waypoint menus, to make room so I can keep tags logically arranged.


* Ordering bots -

Go to your halflife/foxbot/tfc folder and create a file called foxbot_commanders.txt

Open this file in notepad and add wonids for all players you wish to give commander access to.
1 wonid per line.

Only the people with the wonids in this list will be able to give the bots commands.
There are 2 commands currently implemented. Commands are given through team chat during play.

** You will need to be running Neo-TF in order to see these features.
