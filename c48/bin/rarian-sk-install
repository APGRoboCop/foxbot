# A simple replacement for scrollkeeper-install / scrollkeeper-uninstall
# scrollkeeper-preinstall
# The real program install program is called from scrollkeeper-update
# The real uninstall program isn't used.  Ever.
# scrollkeeper-preinstall is another random program.  I've read the
# source and still can't figure out exactly what it does.  It seems
# to do some stuff that should be really done by configure scripts
# (replacing the docpath with another)

# In the New World Order, these are unneccessary, so we just ignore
# them and exit happily.

# However, since these are installed and available for use, we
# have to "emulate" them by (basically) returning true.
# Don't ever ask me why scrollkeeper works the way it does.  I'll
# bore you to tears.

# Anyway, if you've read this far, the license for this file is simple:
# Use it however you want.  Seriously, if you want to give me credit
# for an empty file, go ahead.  Use it any way you want.  I offer
# no guarentees about functioning correctly, however since the script
# is simpler than "Hello World", I don't think it'll go wrong.

# We ignore all user input and return
# Update.
